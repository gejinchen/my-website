I am Jinchen Ge, an AI engineer at Graphcore. Currently, I am working on speeding up machine learning models using Graphcore's IPUs. Prior to Graphcore, I was a CS MPhil student at the University of Cambridge, under the supervision of [Nicholas Lane](http://niclane.org/). My MPhil project investigated zero-shot learning on IMU-based human activity recognition, and the thesis was accepted by IMWUT/UbiComp 2022. Before this, I studied at Imperial College London and the University of Bristol.
